				"headline": "The Perceptron",
				"text": " In 1957, Frank Rosenblatt combined Hebb’s neural theory with Arthur Samuel’s machine learning work to create the perceptron, originally designed as software for the IBM 704 and installed in the custom-built Mark I perceptron machine for image recognition. Though hailed as the first successful neuro-computer, the Mark I fell short in recognizing complex patterns like faces, leading to disillusionment and a decline in neural network research. This setback stalled progress until a resurgence of interest in the 1990s revived machine learning efforts."

It was one of the first methods used to tackle the traveling salesperson problem by having the program visit the closest unvisited city at each step. While Marcello Pelillo is credited with the \"nearest neighbor rule,\" he attributes its origins to the influential 1967 paper by Cover and Hart."
